# 10key_typing_drills

This program was designed back in 2008. It admittedly serves a very small market, people who want to practice speed drills using the 10-key number pad of their keyboard.
This skill is probably of limited use to most people. In the 14 years this project has been hosted at SourceForge, it's only had 200 downloads. However, when I was an auditor early in my career, I had to perform a lot of numerical data entry under tight time constraints, and so found this skill worth practicing. I shared this project in case others found themselves in similar circumstances, and them promptly forgot about it until recently, when somebody asked for an update.

Well, here is an update.


The orginal project is still listed over at SourceForge:

# Original Description
This program provides exercise material to practice typing on the number-pad (aka. the 10key). It provides a long sequence of numbers for the user to type. This does not (yet) calculate accuracy or speed, but simply provides a means to practice.
